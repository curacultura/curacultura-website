        <p id="desc">As a curator, fervent reader and traveller, Jule’s passion is to tell stories of the world as it is today through objects and artworks.

Previously a curator and producer of exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, she went on to tell musical stories at the Royal Opera House in Oman, and then joined the British design agency Cassonmann for the conception of the Musée national de la Marine in Paris. Fascinated by languages and the bridge across cultures that is translation, she also worked with the non-profit ATLAS and the Institut Français to promote the translation of Arabic literature in Europe, where she discovered the nourishing world of artistic residencies. Her diverse skills enrich international cultural structures working at the intersection between arts, music and literature.</p>
