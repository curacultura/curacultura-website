        </div>
        <p>CuraCultura is not just a company. It is also a philosophy, defined by its very name: we care for people through culture, and we care for culture for the good of people. We set out to make the cultural sector a kinder place for all who inhabit it, whether permanent tenants or infrequent visitors, workers and participants alike. For this reason, we are creating this Manifesto for cultural carers everywhere- which means it isn’t only our decision as to what it should look like. Please submit your own entries on what caring with, for and about culture can or should look like, and upon review, we might insert them into the Manifesto. All your thoughts are valid, so we will look after every single one in our database.</p>

     <ul id="smallprint">
            <li>By submitting an entry to the Manifesto, I accept the storage, editing and onwards use by CuraCultura of this work. </li>
            <li>Suggestions will be reviewed first and foremost to ensure they comply with CuraCultura’s dedication to kindness, fairness, respect, inclusivity and anti-discrimination. If an entry complies with these behaviours, but repeats in sentiment an article already included in the Manifesto, duplication will be avoided although the previous entry might be edited to reframe or reflect an inspiring expression from the newer submission. If the relevance of an entry to the Manifesto is unclear, clarity will be sought before deciding upon its inclusion. CuraCultura does not aim to dictate the parameters of the Manifesto, but will occasionally make an executive decision in the interests of its strength, impact and potential for spreading goodness. All entries will be stored by CuraCultura regardless of repetition or suitability of content. </li>
